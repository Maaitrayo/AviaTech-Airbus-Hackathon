# Washing Machine Manufacturing Data Management System
This is a data management system designed to streamline the process of manufacturing washing machines. It provides a centralized platform for different departments to manage their data related to logistics, supply chain, planning, execution, and forecasting of orders. The platform is designed to reduce redundancy, improve data authenticity, and make data management more sustainable in the long term.

## Tech Stack
The platform is built using the following technologies:

- React - front-end framework
- Node.js - back-end runtime environment
- MongoDB - database management system
- Express.js - web application framework for Node.js
- JWT - JSON Web Token for authentication

## Features
- `Data lake`: The platform has a normalized database that stores all the data related to the manufacturing process, from fabrication to assembly. The database is designed to reduce redundancy and improve data authenticity.

- `Redundant data identification`: The platform can identify redundant data from the forecasted data generated by different departments. This helps to reduce data duplication and ensure that only authentic data is used in the manufacturing process.

- `Real-time data approval`: The platform has an automation process for data stamping (approval) of the real-time data. This ensures that the data is authentic and up-to-date before it is used in the manufacturing process.

- `Domain-specific dashboard`: The platform has a dashboard for each department that allows users to access the data required for their domain. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for data management and visualization.

- `Data officer dashboard`: The platform has a dashboard for the data officer to monitor the data stamping process. The data officer can track the progress of data approval and ensure that all data used in the manufacturing process is authentic.
